# 🧬 Spatial Omics Workflows

This repository documents end-to-end **spatial transcriptomics analysis workflows**, with a focus on **NanoString GeoMx DSP** and related spatial omics platforms.

📄 **Complete analytical methods are documented in [`METHODS.md`](METHODS.md).**

\## Scope



The workflows in this repository cover:



\- Spatial data import and preprocessing

\- Quality control of regions of interest (ROIs)

\- Normalization and feature selection

\- Dimensionality reduction and clustering

\- Spatial visualization and tissue mapping

\- Differential expression across spatial domains

\- Pathway enrichment and PI-facing summary outputs



This repository is written in a \*\*methods-appendix style\*\* and reflects

real analytical workflows rather than a turnkey software package.

\## Intended audience



\- Faculty and principal investigators  

\- Computational biology collaborators  

\- Bioinformatics reviewers  

\- Trainees seeking structured spatial omics workflows  



---



\## Reproducibility



Raw spatial data and sensitive metadata are intentionally excluded.

Scripts may require adaptation to specific platforms, datasets, or

computing environments.

\# Resources



This directory contains reference files, example inputs, and

supplementary materials used by the spatial omics workflows.



No raw or sensitive data are included.
